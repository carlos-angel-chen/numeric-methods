# Numerical Methods
1Q - 2022

Syllabus: During the 1st quarter of 2022, i've been coding in python with my teammates to complete the subject.

## TP1: 
Write a class that implements 16-bit IEEE 754 floating point. The class name should be Binary16 and it should have two accessible members:

- bits: a list of 1s and 0s corresponding to the bits of the number.
- d: a double-precision floating-point number (64 bits) equivalent to the represented number. In the case that the represented number is ±inf or NaN, d should be ±inf or NaN

The class initialization function should receive a double-precision floating-point number that must be converted to 16-bit IEEE 754. The class should also implement the following numerical operations:

- product: ab, a=b;
- quotient: a/b, a/=b;
- equality comparison: a == b; inequality comparison: a != b.

Write in the same file a function with no arguments called test that tests the correct operation of the implemented class.

## TP2: 
Write a function that solves the linear least squares problem using Cholesky decomposition.

## TP3:

## TP4: 
Write a function that implements the Runge-Kutta 4 method to solve a system of differential equations.
